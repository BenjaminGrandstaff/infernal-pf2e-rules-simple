//! Goal: give Kubernetes something to probe. This service's real work loop
//! only ever makes outbound calls (to the kernel and to its own
//! database), so without this there would be no inbound listener at all
//! -- and no way for Kubernetes to notice a database that has gone
//! unreachable, since readiness is the only thing that depends on it.
//!
//! Deliberately minimal: no signing, no routing beyond two fixed paths,
//! no dependency on infernal-client-rs (this is not a governed call).
//! `/health/ready` is the only path that touches this service's own database,
//! matching the failure semantics this service documents in its README:
//! a database outage should be visible to Kubernetes, not silently
//! ignored.
